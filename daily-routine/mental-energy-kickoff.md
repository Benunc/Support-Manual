# Mental Energy Kick-Off
How you start your day often impacts how productive of a day you will have. As a Support Technician, rushing into answering tickets can drain you very quickly. The Mental Energy Kick-Off is designed to help you start your day outside of tickets in a way that motivates you and gives you momentum to hit the tickets with energy. It's also an excellent way to be reminded that your work is much bigger than just being a "professional emailer". 

Finding exactly what you should do for your Metal Energy Kick-off depends a lot on what motivates you about Support work. But here are some suggestions:

## Documentation
We're always in need of updates to existing docs and writing of new docs. Start your day by reviewing our existing [Give Docs issues](https://github.com/WordImpress/Give-Docs/issues) and spend some time knocking a few out.

## Level-Up Your WordPress Knowledge
