# Queue Health Habits (or `#QHH`)
Every work day, support technicians are expected and required to use the last 30 minutes of the work day to “decompress” by doing something that is not ticket-related. While still work-related (this time is not meant to be personal time), activities here can include writing blog posts for company properties, reading through GitHub to keep up with the latest development updates, or professional development like taking development courses.

In order to prioritize decompress time, in advance of that every day technicians should cycle through all active tickets in their assigned box to set the expectation that a response is coming tomorrow.

At minimum twice per week we cycle back through our pending and assigned tickets to perform #LogoutHabits. 
## Review/Close Pending Tickets
Since our first response is designed to be thorough, many times it will resolve the problem, and the customer simply does not reply back. At least twice per week, we’ll reply to those tickets with a “Close Ticket due to inactivity” canned response, which encourages a response from the customer, and then if they do not reply by the next day, we close the ticket. 

Also, during that time, ensure that any cc'd emails were correctly added to the original reply, and if not, reply with an apology for not cc’ing correctly.
## Review waiting-on-fix
Tickets that have identified issues and bugs are tagged as waiting-on-fix in Help Scout, and left as pending. During #QHH time, review the associated GitHub issue (or add the github issue to the top of the ticket in a note) and respond accordingly. 
### Issue is resolved
Reply to the customer with either the version of the add-on or Give core that the issue is fixed in, and close the ticket, after removing the waiting-on-fix tag. 

### Issue is not resolved, but actively being worked on

It is meaningful for our customers to hear back that “we’ve not forgotten about this issue, and the dev team is currently working on it.”

Be careful not to over-promise on a release timeline. 

### Issue is not resolved, and has seen no movement

If we check and discover an issue has not received any attention based on the github issue, we ping the Head of Support or the Senior Support technician to add the appropriate label on github, at their discretion. 

If you’ve responded more than once with “I just checked and the dev team is not currently working on this issue” or similar, use discretion “poking the bear” here. Understand and empathize that an issue which is not what the dev team deems “critical” is still critical to a customer (especially if their boss, board, or donors are asking about it). 
## Review/Add Tags
Navigate to “closed” tickets as well as your assigned tickets, and tag them where necessary. No ticket should be untagged.
