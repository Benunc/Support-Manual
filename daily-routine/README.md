As a distributed team, we highly value clear expectations and communication regarding what we are doing. This is not for the purposes of micromanagement so much as to keep the whole team informed of activity and give Support Leadership a simple way to know what's happening at any given time. 

Here's a general overview of what is expected throughout the day. Any significant deviation from this should be discussed with the team.

* Login to Slack and announce that you’re starting your day (using `@here` is useful so you only ping those who are currently online)
* Start the day with a 30-40 minute [Mental Energy Kickoff](mental-energy-kickoff.md) -- report in the appropriate slack channel what you accomplished.
* [Unassigned/Assigned](unassigned-vs-assigned.md) -- always communicate in #Support whenever you are switching between Docs, or Unassigned, or Assigned
    * If it’s before 5:00 AM Pacific, check on Unassigned, If it’s out of control, get it in control. Otherwise, get as much Assigned done as you can until 5:00 AM Pacific
    * At 5:00 AM Pacific, work on Unassigned
    * Throughout the rest of your Priority Support time, prioritize 1st response times, and resolving Assigned tickets.
* Break -- Announce your break and when you’ll be back. During your break eat, walk, or do something that gives you a MENTAL/PHYSICAL break. DO NOT be at your computer. Your break should be roughly 40-60 minutes.
* Throughout your day, do your [#QueueHealthHabits](queue-health-habits.md). This is particularly important to do before you move into "Decompress Time".
* 30 Minutes before the end of your day, do something productive outside of Priority Support as [Decompress Time](decompress-time.md).
