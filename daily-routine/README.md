As a distributed team, we highly value clear expectations and communication regarding what we are doing. This is not for the purposes of micromanagement, so much as to help both the support tech and the head of support maximize their efficiency and job satisfaction. 

Here's a general overview of what is expected throughout the day. Any siginifcant deviation from this should be discussed with the team.

* Login to Slack and announce that you’re starting your day
* Start the day with 30-40 minutes with [Mental Energy Kickoff time](mental-energy-kickoff.md) -- report in the appropriate slack channel what you accomplished.
* [Unassigned/Assigned](unassigned-vs-assigned.md) -- always communicate in #Support whenever you are switching between Docs, or Unassigned, or Assigned
    * If it’s before 5am Pacific, check on Unassigned, If it’s out of control, get it in control. Otherwise, get as much Assigned done as you can until 5am
    * At 5am Pacific, work on Unassigned
    * Throughout the rest of your Priority Support time, prioritize 1st response times, and resolving Assigned tickets.
* Break -- Announce your break and when you’ll be back. Eat, walk, do something for 40-60 minutes that gives you a MENTAL/PHYSICAL break. DO NOT be at your computer.
* Throughout your day, do your [#QueueHealthHabits](queue-health-habits.md), but especially toward the end of the day make time to ensure they happen.
* 30 Minutes before the end of your day, do something productive outside of Priority Support as [Decompress Time](decompress-time.md).
