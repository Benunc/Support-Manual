# Daily Routine Overview

Intro paragraph and overview:

* Login to Slack and announce that you’re starting your day
* Start the day with 30-40 minutes with Docs -- report in #documentation what you accomplished
* Unassigned/Assigned -- always communicate in #Support whenever you are switching between Docs, or Unassigned, or Assigned
    * If it’s before 5am Pacific, check on Unassigned, If it’s out of control, get it in control. Otherwise, get as much Assigned done as you can until 5am
    * At 5am Pacific, work on Unassigned
    * Throughout the rest of your Priority Support time, prioritize 1st response times, and resolving Assigned tickets.
* Break -- Announce your break and when you’ll be back. Eat, walk, do something for 40-60 minutes that gives you a MENTAL/PHYSICAL break. DO NOT be at your computer.
* 1.5 hours before end of day, do your #LogoutHabits
* 30 Minutes before the end of your day, do something productive outside of Priority Support to “decompress”.
