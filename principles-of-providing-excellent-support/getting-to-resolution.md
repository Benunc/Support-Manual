# Getting to Resolution

Beyond the first response, every interaction with a customer in support has a singular goal: we get to resolution.

We solve our customer’s problems, in 3 replies or fewer. A resolved ticket is one that has at least one reply from the customer after the initial contact, and has been marked closed by us. We don’t mark a ticket as closed until it is confirmed resolved.

The first response is always marked as Pending, waiting for the customer to confirm the fix. We encourage a response from the customer, so that we can confirm that fix, and have an additional touchpoint with the customer. 

If they do not follow up, we reach back out 3-5 days later with the “Close Ticket due to inactivity” canned response from Help Scout, and if no response then, close without a third reply.
