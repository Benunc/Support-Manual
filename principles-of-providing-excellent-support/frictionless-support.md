One of the biggest pain points for customers in any sort of support interaction is the feeling of being made to jump through hoops or repeat themselves because they didn't use the correct channel. 

We call this hoop-jumping and repetition "friction" and it is the enemy of providing excellent support. The different types of friction generally fall into three types:

1. People with urgent issues who need to be helped when a support technician is leaving for the day.
1. Customers who ask for something other than technical support in the Support inbox.
1. Customers who have answers that need escalation to the Head of Support.

##Using the Urgent Tag
When a customer's live site is actively not taking donations (after a period of having taken them) this is an urgent issue. All replies on urgent-tagged tickets should be placed back in the "Unassigned" Help Scout box so that they receive attention as soon as possible. 

This requires some discretion on the part of us as support technicians: just because an issue is urgent to a customer does not make it an urgent-tagged ticket.

Even if the person contacting us is on a tight deadline and has tremendous urgency, it does not fit the criteria for the urgent tag unless the site was previously accepting donations and now is no longer. 

By this definition, a site that is not live yet or has never taken donations before can't have an urgent-tagged issue. 

###Responding to Urgent tagged tickets
When a ticket is marked as urgent (according to the above definition) and left in the unassigned box. all technicians on the unassigned box are to prioritize it. 

That doesn't necessarily mean that they should be the one to answer, but that they should alert the technician who tagged it to answer when there is a response from the customer. 

If the original technician is out for the day at the time of the customer response, the remaining technician(s) should take over the ticket, and respond.
