# Knowing the Product

The single most important aspect of excellent support is knowledge of the product. As technical support, nothing can replace deep knowledge of the product functionality, features, and areas of known weakness.

During the first 6 weeks of working in tech support, perhaps the most valuable time is spent in purposeful exploration of the product, as well as reviewing tickets already answered by other technicians.

It’s not expected or realistic for support technicians to be experts in every area of every product. Instead, it’s expected that technicians be constantly learning, and honest about where they are in product knowledge and experience. 

To that end, it is encouraged that support technicians ask questions in the #support channel on Slack when they run into areas they are unfamiliar with. This helps everyone grow in product knowledge.
